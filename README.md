# FeedbackBot
A Discord bot used by the XMage Draft Historical Society (XDHS) that allows members to send anonymous feedback to the XDHS team.

Anonymity of messages can be verified by looking at the on_slashcmmand function in feedbackbot.cpp - no data about the command user is collected, stored or logged.

Needs the "Use Application Commands" permission enabled for the channel members will use the command in.

Requires DPP: https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP
