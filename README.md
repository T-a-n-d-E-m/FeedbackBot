# FeedbackBot
A simple Discord bot that allows members to send anonymous messages/feedback to a designated channel.

Needs the "Use Application Commands" permission enabled for the channel members will use the command in.

Anonymity of messages can be verified by looking at the on_slashcmmand function in feedbackbot.cpp - no data about the command user is collected, stored or logged.
